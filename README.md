# maintenance-queue-time-analysis

This repository contains a study aimed at investigating the effect of a new process on the average queue time (in minutes) in the maintenance department of a certain industry. The objective of this activity is to verify if the new process can effectively reduce the average queue time compared to the current policy.

To achieve this, two datasets were collected:

- Control Group: Samples of queue times from a long historical period under the current policy.
- Treatment Group: Samples of queue times after implementing the new process.

The analysis will compare these datasets to determine the impact of the new process on queue times.
